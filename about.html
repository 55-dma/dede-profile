        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hey Beautiful Souls -- I'm currently a full-time student at Ivy Tech Community College, pursuing my
            Associate's Degree in Software Development. My journey into web design started with a simple desire to
            create something beautiful and functional on the internet. Over the years, I've honed my skills in HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and various design tools to bring my visions to life. I believe that a great website is
            not just about aesthetics but also about providing an exceptional user experience. I'm passionate about
            helping businesses and individuals establish their online presence with style and flair. When I'm not
            designing websites, you can find me exploring new design trends, experimenting with colors, or simply
            enjoying the beauty of nature. Let's create something amazing together!
        </p>

        <h2>What matters MOST to me...</h2>

        <p>As a web designer, what matters most to me is creating websites that not only look stunning but also
            provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience. I believe that a website should be a reflection of the
            brand's identity and values, while also being accessible and easy to navigate for all users. I am
            committed to using my creativity and technical skills to craft websites that not only meet but exceed my
            clients' expectations. I strive to create designs that are not only visually appealing but also
            functional and user-friendly, ensuring that every visitor has a positive experience on the site.
            Ultimately, my goal is to help my clients establish a strong online presence that resonates with their
            target audience and drives meaningful engagement

        <h3>Skills & Tools</h3>

        <p>My skill set includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various design tools such as Adobe
            Photoshop, Video Studio Code, Git. I am also experienced in responsive design, ensuring that websites
            look great on all devices. I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and
            technologies in web design to provide the best possible service to my clients. I am passionate about
            creating websites that are not only visually stunning but also highly functional, fast, and optimized
            for search engines. I am dedicated to delivering high-quality work that meets the unique needs of each
            client, and I take pride in my ability to bring creative ideas to life through my designs. Whether it's
            a simple portfolio site or a complex e-commerce platform, I am confident in my ability to create a
            website that exceeds expectations and helps my clients achieve their online goals.</p>
