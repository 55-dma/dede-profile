# 🌸 Dottie “DeDe” Andrews

Hi! I’m Dottie — but everyone calls me **DeDe**. I’m a front‑end web designer returning to school to refresh my skills and strengthen my JavaScript knowledge. I enjoy creating soft, welcoming designs using navy blues, pinks, and purples, and this project is part of my ongoing growth as a developer.

Every update helps me sharpen my skills.
