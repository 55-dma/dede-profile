# 🌸 Dottie Andrews

Hi! I’m Dottie — a full‑time Software Development student at Ivy Tech Community College. I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub, and this project is where I practice, experiment, and grow my skills one step at a time.

I love creating soft, welcoming designs with navy blues, pinks, and purples, and I’m excited to keep building my confidence as a new developer.
